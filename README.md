# CodeDocumentation-with-Gen-AI
This repository contains my master's thesis titled "Generative AI for automated legacy mainframe documentation", written during my internship at Euronext Securities Milan. \

For privacy reasons, the code and the prompts cannot be shared in this repository. \

The goal of the project was to explore the potential of generative AI tools in addressing mainframe modernization challenges by facilitating the transformation of outdated codebases and architectures into modern and understandable ones. This thesis aims to demonstrate how large language models (LLMs) can automate code understanding and refactoring, starting with the production of functional documentation of COBOL applications. 
Closed-source and open-source models were employed and compared to see how they perform on the task and to evaluate whether their performances can match. Significant effort was invested in prompt engineering to optimize the model's outputs. Finally, an evaluation framework was established to assess the results, focusing on metrics such completeness, clarity and consistency.
